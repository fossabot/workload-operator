# Datum Workload Operator

The workload operator defines APIs and core controllers for interacting
with compute infrastructure related entities such as Workloads and Instances.

Workload and Instance API types include references to types defined in the
[network-services-operator][network-services-operator] project, such as Networks
and Network Policies, in order to attach to networks or influence instance
network connectivity.

The operator itself is not responsible for provisioning of resources, but
instead relies on infrastructure providers such as the
[GCP Infrastructure Provider][infra-provider-gcp] to interact with vendor or
platform specific APIs in order to satisfy the intents defined in custom resources

See the [Workloads RFC](./docs/compute/development/rfcs/workloads/README.md) for
details on the goals of this project.

## Documentation

Documentation will be available at [docs.datum.net](https://docs.datum.net/)
shortly.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- go version v1.23.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.31.0+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.31.0+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/tmp:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/tmp:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
